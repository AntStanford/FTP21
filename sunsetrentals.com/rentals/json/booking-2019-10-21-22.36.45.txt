Sleeping for 8 and a location close to the Haywood Cafe, Snake River Saloon, and (our fav) Dos Locos.\n\nSleeping Set Up - The Master Bedroom has a very comfy King Size bed. The second bedroom has a Queen bed and a pair of bunk beds. The couch in the living room folds out. \n\nKitchen - There\u0027s a full kitchen including all cooking utensils and service for 12.  A small but fully stocked grocery store in the building makes it very easy to quickly obtain the ingredients that you need in order to cook. Or, you can walk across the street to another small grocery store with a slightly bigger selection.  Or, if you have a car, you can drive (or take the bus) to the slightly bigger grocery store on Tennis Club Dr. down the road or to the big-big grocery store in Dillon (City Market) which is about 20 min away. However you choose to do it, you\u0027re covered.\n\nIf you don\u0027t want to cook, you can either go the route of frozen meals (available from the grocery store in the building or across the street), or make a 1 minute walk to the Haywood Cafe (in the building), the Snake River Saloon (just a short walk across the parking lot) or Dos Locos (across the street - the salsa is epic). The grocery store in the building even offers a small but decent selection of wine and beers other than the usual fare one would expect.\n\nLiving Area - The main living area is very open. It offers room for kids to play with their toys or for folks to stretch and perhaps do some yoga (a mat and basic props for practice are available). Or, you can sit at the dining area and watch the family while you glance at the game on the TV.  Or you can sit at the bar in the kitchen while your partner makes a meal.  Or, you can *get away* and sit at the nice little table with two bar-chairs that looks out the windows while you enjoy your coffee in the morning before heading out or to focus and get a little work done on your laptop. It\u0027s up to you.  There\u0027s also a gas fireplace and a patio. \n\nPatio - the patio is a nice place to go out and enjoy the view of the mountain.  We have 2 chairs and a table out there.  It\u0027s great in the summer or when the snow is falling! \n\nBathroom - There are 2 bathrooms, one attached to the Master bedroom and the other down a short hall with the second bedroom. Each bathroom has 2 sinks, a tub and separate shower. There is plenty of shelf space for stuff to reside and plenty of hooks on which to hang wet gear.  Both are private to each bedroom.  \n\nCloset - There\u0027s a coat closet just inside the front door and large closets in each of the bedrooms. \n\nSuit Up Area - In the entryway is a great little spot to sit on a bench and pull off your shoes to tuck them out of the way and to hang your gear from the hooks on the wall. \n\nOther Amenities - The living room and both bedrooms have flatscreen TVs mounted on the walls with basic cable (including HBO) and you can log in to different content providers as well (Netflix, Hulu, Amazon) using your own accounts. A wifi network exists for all of your connected devices. For an internet connection in the mountains, the speed is pretty good. Secure and warm garage parking is available under the building which is great. It is however first come first serve. We also have a USB charging station for your connected devices (bring your own cables) and we have a Bluetooth speaker so that you can listen to your jamz.\n\nThe ski lockers (for storing your skis and boards) are very nice and are located on the first floor to the left of the elevator that services our wing of the building.  Keys are hanging to the left of the front door to our unit.  \n\nWasher Dryer - there\u0027s a small Washer\/Dryer in the unit. Make sure to clean the lint screen, please!\n\nViews and Location - You can see the slopes from the large windows and - this is great - you can walk over to the Keystone River Run Gondola or Mountain House lifts in 10 minutes which means you don\u0027t have to ","houseRules":"Rules for this unit are as follows:\nPets are not allowed.\nSmoking is not permitted.\nChildren are allowed.\nThe minimum age limit for this unit is 25.","nodeId":32,"unitType":{"id":17,"name":"2 - Mountain XL"},"lodgingType":{"id":2,"name":"Condo"},"directions":"Drive around to the rear of the building, there is a garage in center that goes underneath the building.
